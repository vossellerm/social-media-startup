# social-media-startup

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. In this app, I have built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I use a JavaScript date library to format timestamps.
